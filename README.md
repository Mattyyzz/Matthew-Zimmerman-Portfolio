# Java- URL Creation Project 

This project involved developing a Java application to dynamically generate and manage URLs for websites. I utilized fundamental Java programming concepts such as object-oriented design, encapsulation (using getters and setters for attributes), and user input handling (using the Scanner class). By incorporating these Java properties, the program ensured robustness and flexibility in constructing URLs based on user-specified domain, subdomain, path, and security preferences (HTTP or HTTPS). Additionally, users could indicate whether the website served a non-profit or for-profit purpose, influencing the URL's structure and content presentation. This approach combined practical URL management with essential Java skills for effective software development.

# URL Class

My first class, the Url class, serves as a blueprint for representing and managing URL attributes within a Java application. It encapsulates essential components such as the complete URL, domain, optional subdomain, path, and security status (secure or not). Through its setter methods, it allows for dynamic updating of these attributes, ensuring that the complete URL is consistently updated based on any changes. The class also includes methods like printUrlInfo() to display comprehensive information about the URL, including whether the site is non-profit or for-profit, which is crucial for distinguishing between different types of organizations.
